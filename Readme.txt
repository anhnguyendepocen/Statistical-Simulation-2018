I have used Jupyter Notebook i.e. interactive python for writing my code. It is very popular nowdays as this is very user friendly for e.g. you can also write LaTeX code into it. I am also including pdf version of my code in case jupyter notebook is not available on your laptop. 

Following library was used:
1. numpy (most useful library for arrays - in all questions)
2. sympy (in question 4)
3. matplotlib (for plotting graphs)

There are 6 different .ipynb files (extension for jupyter notebook) and their pdf versions.

I am also including necessary graphs and plots.

Writeup file is available under the name "Writeup_Simulation_Assignment.pdf". 

Thanks
